# practicalmachinelearning

After a goods night rest (of 3 hours) I figured it out. You're not suppost to view the report in the default repository. You can view it through the github io pages: https://micheldeleeuw.github.io/practicalmachinelearning/ 

--------------------------------------------

Even though the files are uploaded exactly like it is described in https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-ghPagesSetup.md, the html doesn't seems to be viewable after commiting it to the repository.
I added a pdf version of the html, so if you are having trouble reading the html, please be so kind to use the pdf. The pdf is created directly from the html by printing to pdf.

Kind regards,

Michel de Leeuw
